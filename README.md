# geodesiclm

Geodesic Levenberg-Marquardt is a variant of Levenberg-Marquardt that adds third order corrections to the proposed step from the directional second derivative (either by a finite difference estimate or an analytic evaluation).

This is a fork of the [geodesicLM](https://sourceforge.net/projects/geodesiclm/) repository hosted on SourceForge.
